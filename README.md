# Market Anomaly Detection System

## Overview
The **Market Anomaly Detection System** is a machine learning project designed to identify and detect potential financial market anomalies or crises based on historical financial data. Using advanced preprocessing and multiple machine learning models, this project evaluates various metrics to predict and classify market events with high accuracy.


## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handles missing values, normalization, and scaling.
  - Splits the dataset into training and testing subsets.
- **Model Comparison**:
  - Implements multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
  - Compares models based on accuracy and classification metrics.
- **Visualization**:
  - Provides performance metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy.
- **Modular Design**:
  - Cleanly organized code for scalability and reusability.


## Tech Stack:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Handling: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`
  - Model Persistence: `joblib`
 
## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate deep learning models for improved accuracy.
- Develop an interactive dashboard for visualizing anomalies in real-time.
- Explore hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.
