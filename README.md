# Financial Market Anomaly Detection

This project involves building an anomaly detection system that serves as an early warning mechanism for identifying potential financial market crashes before they occur. Using data and machine learning models, the system classifies market conditions and proposes investment strategies for risk mitigation and optimization. This program compares and evaluates three different models, logisitic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting and then chooses to save the one with the best overall accuracy based on the classification report.

Tech Stack: python, pandas, scikit-learn, joblib
